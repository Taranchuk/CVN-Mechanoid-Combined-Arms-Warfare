		<description>The exostrider is a colossal six legged mech that employs a single large weapon to devistating effect, primarily used as a means to support troops from the back has a small risk of friendly fire if not used carefully \n\nThis version employs a large molecular disruptor which causes solid walls to crumble under their own weight and living things to become extremely volatile causing them to explode on death \n\nThe disruptor requires 5 high energy canisters to fire \nWhen linked to a mechanitor it provides an independent command range in a radius of 50 \nIn addition, it also provides 30 bandwith to the mechanitor in command.</description>
